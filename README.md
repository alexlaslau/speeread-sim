# Speeread Simulation

Speeread Simulation is a web-based application that helps users practice and improve their speed reading skills. It presents text word by word at increasing speeds, allowing users to challenge themselves and gradually enhance their reading speed.

## Features

- Adjustable reading speed (words per minute)
- Automatic speed increase after each round
- Start and stop controls
- Display of current reading speed

## How It Works

1. The application takes a predefined text in Romanian about the value of reading.
2. Users input their desired starting reading speed in words per minute.
3. Upon clicking "Start", the text is displayed one word at a time at the specified speed.
4. The speed automatically increases by 40 words per minute after each complete run through the text.
5. Users can stop the simulation at any time using the "Stop" button.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter your desired starting speed (in words per minute) in the input field.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
3. The text will be displayed word by word at the specified speed.
4. The speed will automatically increase after each complete run through the text.
5. Click the "Stop" button at any time to end the simulation.
